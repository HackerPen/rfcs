# HackerPen public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official HackerPen public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/hackerpen/projects/1)

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [HackerPen public feedback discussions](https://github.com/HackerPen/roadmap/discussions)).

The roadmap repository is for communicating HackerPen's roadmap. Weâ€™re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of HackerPen products and features. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through [general feedback in HackerPen public discussions](https://github.com/HackerPen/roadmap/discussions/new?category=general).

## Roadmap and Feedback

HackerPen has two product intake process, *feedback** and **roadmap**. Each process has its own dedicated purpose and Github repo:

- Roadmap ([Github](https://github.com/HackerPen/roadmap)): driven by HackerPen core team. They tend to be big bets or [big rocks](https://resources.franklincovey.com/the-8th-habit/big-rocks-stephen-r-covey) that the team prioritize. Every roadmap item is an issue.
- Feedback ([Github](https://github.com/HackerPen/feedback)): driven by the HackerPen community. They tend to be bugs or feature requests, every piece of feedback is an issue.


## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- One or more **product SKU** labels that indicate which product SKUs we expect the feature to be available in. For a list of current product SKUs, see below.

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant [Changelog](https://hackerpen.medium.com/) post.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha:** *Primarily for testing and feedback*\
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.

- **beta:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*\
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

- **ga:** *Generally available to all customers*\
Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

- **in development:**\
Feature under development. We have designed a solution and are actively implementing it

- **in design:**\
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.
