# HackerPen RFCs

RFCs for changes to HackerPen

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the React core team.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the project.

## What the process is
In short, to get a major feature added to HackerPen, one usually first gets the RFC merged into the RFC repo as a markdown file. At that point the RFC is 'active' and may be implemented with the goal of eventual inclusion into HackerPen.

For now, HackerPen team uses RFCs to build major features in the open. In the future, HackerPen will be open sourced, and RFCs will also be used to manage major features contributed by the community.


## Inspiration
React's RFC process owes its inspiration to the [React RFC process](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs).

We've changed it in the past in response to feedback, and we're open to changing it again if needed.
